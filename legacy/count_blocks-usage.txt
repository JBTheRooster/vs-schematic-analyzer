Vintage Story Schematic Block Counter (v1.0 â€“ PowerShell Version)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Author: JBTheRooster / 601G Studios
Created: 2025

This PowerShell script was the original version of what would become the
Vintage Story Schematic Analyzer (VSSA). It parses schematic `.json` files
exported from Vintage Story (via WorldEdit) and counts how many of each
block ID appears in the build.

It also maps those numeric block IDs to block codes using the BlockCodes
dictionary embedded in the file.

------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the script in a text editor or the PowerShell IDE (Windows PowerShell ISE).

2. Modify the top of the script where it defines the file path:

   Example:
   $jsonPath = "C:\Users\You\Documents\RoosterKeep.json"

3. Run the script inside the PowerShell IDE so you can read the output.
   If you right-click and "Run with PowerShell," the window will close immediately
   after execution.

   To run inside PowerShell terminal manually:
   cd "C:\Path\To\Script"
   .\count_blocks.ps1

4. The script will output a sorted list of block ID counts and their corresponding codes.
